<p><span style="font-size:150%"><b>Intent Classifier Using BERT</b></span><br>
BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model made possible of achieving State-of-the-art result for finding the key state of the conversation.BERT is built on top of multiple clever ideas by the NLP community. Some examples are ELMo, The Transformer, and the OpenAI Transformer. We have used BERT because it looks both forward and backward so we get best result and it can be best used for small amount of data also.This model will classify two intents based on the dataset provided.</p><br>
<p>Intents classified are:<br>text: What's the best Wireframing tool? 
intent: System Specification
<br>
text: did you install just the jre? 
intent: Settings
<br>
text: I use IBM's 1.4.2 
intent: System Specification</p></div>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:150%"><b>Implented chatbot using gobot model in Deeppavlov</b></span><br>Deeppavlov is a framework which can be used to build models.Among them is <b>gobot model</b> 
which can create a contextual chatbot.Contextual chatbot are created with the help of intent. 
This chatbot will reply to the user according to intent which will make the conversation between the user and bot more contextualized.
<br> The before model which found the intent with the help of BERT is implemented in gobot model by using RNN approach.In gobot model
the dataset is a labelled data ,so that the the conversation between the user and the bot is improved.</p>
<p>When the user ask a problem to the bot, the output is  <b><p>{{answer}} </p></b> <p>were the intent is "welcomemsg". All the intent in the
  dataset is stored in "template" file.</p>
<p>While training the model the accuracy is found to be 0.76.<br>The intent for each conversation is found with the help of SlotFiller</p>
